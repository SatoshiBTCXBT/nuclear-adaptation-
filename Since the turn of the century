Americas
The Western Hemisphere have been closely connected economically, politically, and socially for most of their modern existence. Growing trade links, increased migrant and refugee flows, internal challenges of corruption and crime, and spillover from failed states are making these connections more important and require closer cooperation between governments and societies to maintain stability, address common challenges, and maximize prosperity across all of the Americas

REGIONS IN FOCUS

Brazil
Since the turn of the century, reforms in Brazil have lifted nearly thirty million citizens out of poverty and targeted social inequality. A champion of regional growth and an influential actor in world politics, Brazil’s future is tied to continued efforts to revitalize its economy and its role on the global stage.


Caribbean
The Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center’s Caribbean Initiative seeks to accelerate the region’s strategic importance as a key partner for the United States. Announced in September 2020, this initiative brings increased recognition to the importance of the Caribbean amid vast hemispheric and global challenges. Establishment of the Caribbean program comes at an historic, defining moment for the region as it battles the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.


Colombia
Colombia and the United States have consolidated a close and mutually-beneficial partnership over the past twenty years. Plan Colombia, a bipartisan foreign policy success, laid the foundation for a strategic alliance that has widened to include sustainable development, trade, hemispheric security, and human rights. Today, Colombia is positioning itself as a leader in the region and the world.


Mexico
Mexico is one of the United States’ top trading partners. The relationship is special. Although ties between the two countries are solid, our partnership today faces important challenges, including rapidly changing political landscapes, shifting economic winds, shared security threats, and a migration crisis extending from Central America.


Central America
An unprecedented wave of irregular migration has brought renewed US and international attention to Central America. Rampant corruption, violence, and lack of economic opportunities have forced thousands to flee in search of a better future. As a new political landscape emerges in the region, the challenge remains: improving the living conditions for citizens. US support is critical to address that challenge.


Venezuela
Once a thriving democracy, Venezuela today is in one of its darkest times in history. Years of economic mismanagement, cronyism, and democratic erosion, further fueled by hyperinflation, power cuts, and shortages of food and medicine, have triggered a humanitarian and migration crisis with reverberations across Latin America and beyond. A peaceful democratic transition will remain as the top priority – and the first step – toward a more prosperous future for Venezuelans and the hemisphere.
