The Global Energy Center promotes energy security by working alongside government, industry, civil society, and public stakeholders to devise pragmatic solutions to the geopolitical, sustainability, and economic challenges of the changing global energy landscape

Economy & Business
The US must lead with allies or risk becoming a bystander in a reshaped international financial system. As the global economy struggles to recover from COVID-19 and rising powers like China assert economic influence, this mission is critical to the long-term prosperity of the United States and its allies. Strong collaboration between the public and private sectors can help revitalize open markets for the twenty-first century.

The evolution of the IMF: A case for IMF 1.5 before Bretton Woods 2.0

By Hung Tran

Bretton Woods Institutions will face enormous challenges going forward. While ambitious reforms are needed, its unlikely they will be seriously considered due to high geopolitical tension and mistrust among major countries. Nevertheless, the need for reform is pressing. Therefore, it is important to look at more feasible reform, narrower in scope and technocratic in nature, to improve the these institutions.

Government Funding Review Process
To protect our independence and reputation and to ensure we are in compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, we have established a process to review potential government funding and to obtain authorization to negotiate financing with a government or state-controlled entity.

The Atlantic Council enjoys a diversified donor base helping to ensure our credibility, integrity, and sustainability. To protect our independence and reputation and to ensure compliance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, we have established a process, approved by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, to review any potential non-US government funding and to receive authorization to obtain financing with a non-US government or state-controlled entity.

The Council considers the following criteria to assess potential projects:

Disclosure: The Council maintains a consistent disclosure policy; donors must accept that the Council will acknowledge publicly the source of the funding, including on our website and in our annual report.
Intellectual Ownership: The Council requires all sponsors to accept our Intellectual Independence Policy and to agree to the Council maintaining intellectual ownership of our work, including any products resulting from the project.
Multiple Funding Sources: When possible, the Council works to ensure that any one project is not dependent on one government funder.
Topics: The Council requires that a project be broader than any potential particular agenda items of the donor; a government cannot fund a report on itself or bilateral relations for example.
Diversity: The Councilâ€”through each of its projectsâ€”endeavors to take into account a range of views and participants (e.g., not only government representatives or those sympathetic to one viewpoint would be included in convenings to generate the intellectual content).
Renewal (as applicable): If we have partnered with the government before or are renewing a grant, we must affirm that this sponsor has respected our independence in previous interactions.
